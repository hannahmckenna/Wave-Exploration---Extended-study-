    So whats the plan?

When first exploring topics for my extended study project I wanted to focus on the things that already interest me. I like doing and making, I like understanding how things work and I like learning through participation. 
Understanding and learning is a large part of my practice and I want to incorporate it as I move forward. Science, and Physics particular, has been a key area of interest for me. I have found in previous projects (<a href="https://www.hnamkna.com/entropy.html" class="link">Exploration of entropy - Portfolio site</a>), learning through doing and creating allows these daunting ideas to seem completely tangible and understandable.

Photography is always the first thing I reach for when I want to explore something and therefore I have an archive of photos. It is very evident throughout this archive that there is a common theme to the things that catch my eye. 
Things such as distortions, ripples and light flares are things that I have always found visually interesting and want to further understand and explore. In joining the dots I found that I could tie each of these visuals to a wave formation. Everything that I seem to find interesting in its nature is the physical illustration of a wave.

Moving forward with my research for my extended study project, my next natural progression is to look back on the work I have done thus far and draw conclusions from my experimentation.
This work will inform how I move forward, and determine the shape this project begins to take. 
I am currently experimenting as a way to learn and understand through making and doing and it is my aim that this method of research will be a dominant  aspect of my extended study but my hope for the next coming phase is to explore why these waves exist and place them in the context of their environment, tying them to commonplace ideas, striping away their typically scientific nature.
