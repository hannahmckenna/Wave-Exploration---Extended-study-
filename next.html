        I will continue with my Experimentation, testing every form of wave and playing with formats of documentation. I will begin to contextualise my research and define a direction.
    </div>

    <div class="text-top-2">
        With my direction refined I hope to explore and find the right mediums to continue experimentations, but this time Allowing myself to step away for the scientific and pulling more towards the conceptual.

    <div class="text-top-3">
        By June I will be ready to go!! I will have my final outcomes coming to a close (I hope to still be making physically even until this point)

        At this point I will compile my research and begin to bring it into a scientific space. Speaking to experts, but this time bringing them my work and allowing them to see it from a point of view very far from their own. This I hope will allow me to broaden my research scope.

    <div class="text-bottom-2">
        By this point my hope is to have created a new context for these scientific ideas and bring them into the everyday. illustrating complex ideas in simple formats.
